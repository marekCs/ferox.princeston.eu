## <a name="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION

Visit **/admin/help/splide_ui** once Splide UI installed to read it in comfort.

Splide is a vanilla JavaScript slideshow/carousel solution leveraging
[Splide](https://github.com/Splidejs/splide).

Please start with the very basic working **Splide X** only if
trouble to build splides. Spending 5 minutes or so will save you hours in
building more complex slideshows.

Splide is inspired by Slick as a module or library, so it has _almost_ the same
structure and power as Slick, only different terminologies. While it has a few
improvements, aside from being vanilla JavaScript, that is without JQuery, a few
issues might or might not be resolved, or inherited.

### Two obvious added values from Slick:
* Splide can have navigation even for Vanilla versions.
* Vanilla JavaScript with _modular_ plugins.

Read more at:
* [Github](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/blazy/-/blob/3.0.x/docs/README.md#first-things-first)
* [Blazy UI](/admin/help/blazy_ui#first)

***
## <a name="requirements"> </a>REQUIREMENTS
1. Splide library at minimum `v4`, tested `4.1.4`, since `2.x`:
   * Download Splide archive from [Splide releases](https://github.com/Splidejs/splide/releases)
   * Extract and rename it to `splide`, so the assets are at:
     + **/libraries/splide/dist/css/splide-core.css**
     + **/libraries/splide/dist/css/splide.min.css** (optional)
     + **/libraries/splide/dist/js/splide.min.js**
     + Or any path supported by core library finder as per Drupal 8.9+. If using
       composer, the library directory is `splidejs--splide`. They are fine.
       The folder `splidejs--splide` takes precedence over `splide`. Be sure
       versions are expected/ updated, including Splide extensions.

2. [Blazy 2.x|3.x](https://drupal.org/project/blazy), to reduce DRY stuffs, and
   as a bonus, advanced lazyloading such as delay lazyloading for below-fold
   sliders,  iframe, (fullscreen) CSS background lazyloading, breakpoint
   dependent multi-serving images, lazyload ahead for smoother UX.
   Check out Blazy installation guides!

***
## <a name="plugins"> </a>PLUGINS
Not all plugins are supported or implemented, below are:  

1. [AutoScroll](https://github.com/Splidejs/splide-extension-auto-scroll):  
   + Splide v4: v0.5.3. Splide v3: v0.3.7.
   + `/libraries/splidejs--splide-extension-auto-scroll` (via packagist)
   + `/libraries/splide-extension-auto-scroll` (via github)
   + Or any supported path by priority, and they must have
     `/dist/js/splide-extension-auto-scroll.min.js`.  

2. [Intersection](https://github.com/Splidejs/splide-extension-intersection):  
   + Splide v4: v0.2.0. Splide v3: v0.1.6.
   + `/libraries/splidejs--splide-extension-intersection` (via packagist)
   + `/libraries/splide-extension-intersection` (via github)
   + Or any supported path by priority, and they must have  
     `/dist/js/splide-extension-intersection.min.js`.

Packagist always takes precedence over Github.
Unless explicitly supported, the reasons for not being supported are:  

* `Grid` has already existing non-js implementation via `Blazy Grid` including
  `Grid Foundation`, `CSS3 Columns Masonry`, `Native Grid` (both layouts:
  two-dimensional ala `GridStack` and one-dimensional ala `Masonry`).  
* `Video` has already existing battle-tested GDPR-friendly media player via
  `Image to iframe` under `Media switch` option.  
* Other plugins, nobody need them, yet. Patches are welcome.

## <a name="installation"> </a>INSTALLATION
Be sure to read the entire docs and form descriptions before working with
Splide to avoid headaches for just ~15-minute read.

1. **MANUAL:**

   Install the module as usual, more info can be found on:

   [Installing Drupal 8 Modules](https://drupal.org/node/1897420)

2. **COMPOSER:**

   ```
   $ composer require npm-asset/splidejs--splide:^4 \
   drupal/splide
   ```
   See [Blazy composer](/admin/help/blazy_ui#composer) for details.
   Bleeding edge releases might not be available weeks after releases at
   Packagist via `npm-asset`, yet. Please go github.
   [Read more](https://github.com/hiqdev/asset-packagist/issues/139).


***
## <a name="configuration"> </a>CONFIGURATION
Visit the following to configure Splide:

1. `/admin/config/media/splide`

   Enable Splide UI sub-module first, otherwise regular 404/403.

2. Visit any entity types:  
  + `/admin/structure/types`
  + `/admin/structure/block/block-content/types`
  + `/admin/structure/media`
  + `/admin/structure/paragraphs_type`
  + etc.

   Use Splide as a formatter under **Manage display** for multi-value fields:
   Image, Media, Paragraphs, Entity reference, or even Text.
   Check out [SPLIDE FORMATTERS](#formatters) section for details.

3. `/admin/structure/views`

   Use Splide as standalone blocks, or pages.
   Check **Use field template** under **Style** if standalone, else unchecked.

4. Specific for `Pagination text` option under `Overridable optionset` >
   `Pagination`. this particular option will:
   - be available if you have the same text field (says `Title`) on **ALL**
     Media entities, or any fieldable entities, excluding Vanilla.
     If you add more media types, be sure to re-add it, else the option is gone.
   - be NOT available for Vanilla, plain Image, Text, etc.


***
## <a name="recommended-modules"> </a>RECOMMENDED MODULES
Splide supports enhancements and more complex layouts.

### OPTIONAL

* [Paragraphs](https://drupal.org/project/paragraphs), to get more complex
  slides at field level.


### SUB-MODULES
The Splide module has several sub-modules:
* Splide UI, included, to manage optionsets, can be uninstalled at production.

* Splide X, included
  to get up and running Splide quickly.
